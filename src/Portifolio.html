      <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>As a third-year Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology, my academic journey has been marked
        by a fervent dedication to mastering the intricacies of software development. Studying Software Engineering at AAiT has
        equipped me with a robust foundation in cutting-edge technologies and problem-solving skills. Complementing my formal
        education, I have also enriched my expertise through the SheCodes front-end development online course, where I delved
        deeper into the world of web development. Through various projects showcased on my GitHub account, I have applied
        theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, honing my skills and showcasing my work to the world. This fusion of
        academic learning and practical experience defines my commitment to continuous growth and excellence in the field of
        software engineering.</p>
